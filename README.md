# SO-directed-issue
training a model to solve SO-directed issue


The issue tracker on GitHub is designed to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs for software project maintainers to address. In contrast, Stack Overflow is a Q&A forum intended for specific programming questions from programmers of all levels of expertise. Despite the clear differences between these two platforms, a common issue arises when questions more suited for Stack Overflow, such as those asking how to implement a function using a specific library, are posted on GitHub’s issue tracker. Developers often redirect these support questions to Stack Overflow as they do not report bugs or propose features. These Stack Overflow-directed issues consume developers’ time and leave the original question unanswered.  

The study investigates the characteristics and trends of Stack Overflow-oriented questions on GitHub’s issue tracker and developed several deep learning models to classify questions posted in the future automatically. The best model got a test accuracy of up to 76.2%. the results of this study emphasize the importance of properly categorizing questions on online platforms. By utilizing deep learning models to automatically classify questions, developers can more efficiently address issues and ensure that questions are directed to the appropriate platform. This, in turn, can lead to quicker and more effective resolutions to programming-related issues.
